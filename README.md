# Rick and Morty Website

This is a Rick and Morty website made in React. In this website you can find information about each character, episode and location from one of the most popular and beloved (by me included) TV shows "Rick and Morty". Data are fetched from GraphQL API https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql using Apollo Client.

Rick and Morty API docs: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

I made this website to learn Typescript, working with public GraphQL API and using GraphQL Clients.

## What have I learned?

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to style this website.
- Using [GraphQL Playground](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).
- Fetching GraphQL data with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).
- Typescript.
- Implementing pagination via [react-paginate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paginate) and infinite scrolling via [react-bottom-scroll-listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bottom-scroll-listener) and Apollo client.
